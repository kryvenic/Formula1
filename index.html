				<em><strong>Thereâ€™s a revolution coming in Formula 1 in 2022</strong></em> and itâ€™s shapedâ€¦ well, much like the car you see in the image above. 
				Here are the 10 key things you need to know about the game-changing 2022 car, a full-scale model of which broke cover at the British Grand Prix on Thursday.

			<h3>Itâ€™s been designed specifically to <strong>promote better racing !</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Whatâ€™s preventing closer racing currently? The effect of the "catastrophic downforce loss" â€“ to quote an engineer centrally involved with the project â€“ resulting from the â€˜dirty airâ€™ being churned chaotically off a leading car currently.
				To put some numbers on it, research shows that current F1 machines lose 35% of their downforce when running three car lengths behind a leading car (approximately 20 metres, 
				measured from the lead carâ€™s nose to the following carâ€™s nose), while closing up to one car length (around 10 metres) results in a 47% loss.
				The 2022 car, developed by Formula 1's in-house Motorsports team in collaboration with the FIA, and putting a heavy onus on the aerodynamic phenomenon known as â€˜ground effectâ€™ (more on which laterâ€¦), 
				reduces those figures to 4% at 20 metres, rising to just 18% at 10 metres.

			<h1><a href="#f1-post2">Lewis Hamilton said <em>he could have died</em></a></h1>
			<h2>In a crash with Max Verstappen after his arch nemesis' car landed on his head</h2>

			<time datetime="13-09-2021">SEP. 13, 2021</time>
			<p>
				<em>Seven-time Formula One world champion</em> Lewis Hamilton said he felt "very,
				very fortunate" to still be alive following a heavy crash with title rival Max Verstappen at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday.
				The two drivers contesting for the sport's biggest prize came together for the second time this season and ultimately both were forced to retire early from the race at Monza.

			<h3>What is the 'halo device' that saved Lewis Hamilton's neck at the Italian GP</h3>
			<p>
				The halo protection device is a curved bar made of titanium and weighed around 7kgs, 
				which is placed around the cockpit that surrounds the driver's head to protect her/him from any serious life-threatening injury. The device is connected by three points to the vehicle frame. 
				It was introduced in 2018 and was made mandatory on every vehicle in Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula Regional, Formula E and also Formula 4 as a new safety measure. 
				It is important to note here that the system is not developed by the teams, it is manufactured by three approved external manufacturers chosen by the FIA.
				<strong>Hamilton also said, "I don't think I've ever been hit on the head by a car before, and it's quite a shock for me."</strong>
